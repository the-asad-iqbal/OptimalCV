      Some crucail things to keep in mind.
      
      Here are key points an AI should keep in mind when auditing a resume to ensure it aligns with best practices:
      1. Structure and Formatting
      Clear Sections: Ensure the resume is divided into recognizable sections (e.g., Contact Info, Summary, Skills, Experience, Education).
      Consistency: Fonts, text size, and spacing should be uniform throughout the resume.
      Length: Ideally, a resume should be 1-2 pages long, depending on experience.
      Use of Bullet Points: Employment and experience details should use bullet points for readability.
      Alignment: Text alignment should be consistent (e.g., left-aligned headers, indented bullet points).
      2. Content Quality
      Relevance: Verify that content focuses on skills and experience relevant to the job the candidate is applying for.
      Action Words: Check for the use of action verbs (e.g., "managed," "developed," "led") to describe achievements.
      Quantifiable Results: Ensure that achievements are quantified (e.g., "increased sales by 20%" rather than "improved sales").
      Conciseness: Content should be concise, with unnecessary or outdated information removed.
      No Overly Technical Terms: Avoid jargon or overly technical language that could confuse non-expert readers.
      3. Grammar and Spelling
      Error-Free: No spelling or grammar mistakes.
      Professional Language: Ensure language is professional and free from informal terms or slang.
      4. Customization and Keywords
      Tailoring for Specific Jobs: The resume should be customized for the job or industry the candidate is targeting.
      ATS Optimization: Verify if the resume contains relevant keywords that match the job description for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) compatibility.
      Avoidance of Graphics: Ensure minimal use of graphics or images, as these may not be parsed well by ATS.
      5. Skills and Competencies
      Core Skills: Ensure the resume highlights the most important and relevant skills (e.g., technical, soft, or domain-specific).
      Balanced Skillset: Check for a balance between hard skills (e.g., coding, design) and soft skills (e.g., leadership, communication).
      Updated Skills: Ensure the candidateâ€™s skills reflect current trends and technologies in their field.
      6. Experience Section
      Chronological Order: Ensure the experience section lists jobs in reverse chronological order.
      Job Titles: Ensure job titles are clear and properly reflect the role.
      Impactful Descriptions: Check whether job descriptions highlight the candidate's impact rather than just duties.
      7. Education Section
      Relevant Education: Verify the inclusion of relevant degrees and certifications, especially for roles requiring formal education.
      Date Consistency: Ensure that dates are listed and consistent.
      8. Contact Information
      Updated Information: Ensure the resume includes an updated phone number, email address, and optionally, a LinkedIn profile.
      No Personal Details: Personal details like marital status, nationality, or gender should generally be omitted, unless required.
      9. Achievements and Certifications
      Certifications: Ensure that industry-relevant certifications are included and up-to-date.
      Achievements: Look for standout achievements that are related to the field.
      10. Portfolio or Links (If Applicable)
      Portfolio: For roles requiring visual or technical work, ensure links to an online portfolio or GitHub are included.
      Clickable Links: Ensure all URLs provided in the resume are clickable and correctly formatted.
      By applying these points, an AI system can effectively audit a resume to ensure it's optimized for both human and machine review.
